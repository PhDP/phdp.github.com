title: Statement on Open Access and Open Source
---

  <p>Short personal statements on <a href="#oa">open access in scientific
publications</a> and <a href="#foss">open source software</a>.</p>

<a name="oa"><h2>Open Access</h2></a> 

  <p>Science is a collective project and I cannot see how, in the era of the 
internet, we can justify hiding our (often publicly funded) research output.
Scientific papers should be available before being submitted to journals for
peer-review using services such as <a href= "http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>, <a
href= "https://github.com/phdp">github</a>, <a href=
"https://bitbucket.org/PhDP"> bitbucket</a>, <a href=
"http://figshare.com/authors/Philippe%20Desjardins-Proulx/98512">FigShare</a>
, etc... I <b>always</b> submit my first-author manuscripts to one of these
services before submitting them to a journal and if the journal does not
tolerate it (e.g.: <i>Ecology Letters</i>), then I submit elsewhere. Also, I
always either store the final PDF on my website or, in the case of open
access publications, link to my paper on the journal's webpage.</p>

  <p>I cannot submit the manuscript to <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv
</a> when I'm not the first author, though I certainly hope the first author
will do so. However, the final PDF will always be accessible on my website.</p>

<a name"foss"><h2>Open Source</h2></a>

  <p>I'm comfortable with the full range of licenses: from the liberal
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT</a> to the more
restrictive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License"
>GPL</a> and even <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software">proprietary software</a>
. In practice, I think the basic infrastructure on which we build software
has to be open source. If software is indeed <a href=
"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html">
eating the world</a>, we would be crazy to let a few interests control
its foundation. Thus, I strongly favor open source <a href =
"http://www.linuxfoundation.org/"> operating systems</a>, <a href=
"http://www.chromium.org/">browsers</a>, <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">
databases</a>, <a href="http://llvm.org/"> compilers</a>, <a href=
"http://www.r-project.org/">interpreters</a>. When it comes to more
specialized software: the more liberal the better (<a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT</a>, <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License">Apache</a>), <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">copyleft</a> if necessary (it <b>did
</b> serve Linux well), but I also understand the need to keep the code
private and adopt a <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software">proprietary license</a>.

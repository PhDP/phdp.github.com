My statement on open source & open access. I'm less radical than people assume for the former, more for the latter http://phdp.github.com/open.html

title: Statement on Open Access and Open Source
---

  <p>Short personal statements on <a href="#oa">open access in scientific
publications</a> and <a href="#foss">open source software</a>.</p>

<a name="oa"><h2>Open Access</h2></a> 

  <p>Science is a collective project and I cannot see how, in the era of the 
internet, we can justify hiding our (often publicly funded) research output.
Scientific papers should be available before being submitted to journals for
peer-review using services such as <a href= "http://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>, <a
href= "https://github.com/phdp">github</a>, <a href=
"https://bitbucket.org/PhDP"> bitbucket</a>, <a href=
"http://figshare.com/authors/Philippe%20Desjardins-Proulx/98512">FigShare</a>
, etc... I <b>always</b> submit my first-author manuscripts to one of these
services before submitting them to a journal and if the journal does not
tolerate it (e.g.: <i>Ecology Letters</i>), then I submit elsewhere. Also, I
always either store the final PDF on my website or, in the case of open
access publications, link to my paper on the journal's webpage.</p>

  <p>I cannot submit the manuscript to <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv
</a> when I'm not the first author, though I certainly hope the first author
will do so. However, the final PDF will always be accessible on my website.</p>

<a name"foss"><h2>Open Source</h2></a>

  <p>I'm comfortable with the full range of licenses: from the liberal
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT</a> to the more
restrictive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License"
>GPL</a> and even <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software">proprietary software</a>
. In practice, I think the basic infrastructure on which we build software
has to be open source. It's the only way to ensure that no single
corporation is in a position to impose its will on software development. If
software is indeed <a href=
"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.htm
l">eating the world</a>, we would be crazy to let . Thus, I strongly favor open source <a href =
"http://www.linuxfoundation.org/"> operating systems</a>, <a href=
"http://www.chromium.org/">browsers</a>, <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">
databases</a>, <a href="http://llvm.org/"> compilers</a>, <a href=
"http://www.r-project.org/">interpreters</a>. When it comes to more
specialized software: the more liberal the better (<a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT</a>, <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License">Apache</a>), <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">copyleft</a> if necessary (it <b>did
</b> serve Linux well), but I also understand the need to keep the code
private and adopt a <a href=
"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software">proprietary license</a>.
</p>

<a name"cmp"><h2>Open Access == Open Source?</h2></a>

  <p>As you can see, my positions on open access and open source are
rather different.</p>

  <p>In short, openess is one way to achieve progress, but other constains might.
The rise of Linux was heavily supported by IBM (server-side), and thanks to
Android and Chrome OS, Google has made more to put Linux devices in the
users' hand than... well, pretty much anyone. It seems to me that, in the
current economic system, companies with import proprieary software made more
for free software than purists.</p>

  <p>There are many arguments against my position. One is that the current
economic system is simply wrong. There is certainly some truth to it, though
my position reflect what I think is right <b>now</b>, not in some
hypothetical system.</p>
